PORTFOLIO will be a PWA

What is a PWA?
    A progressive web app. Progressive web apps
    have their static data cached for use on a desktop, or 
    during network error. OFFLINE/CACHE FIRST behaviour

To do so, we'll use a template provided by CRA
    "npx create-react-app my-app --template cra-template-pwa"
    - integrates Workbox that caches and optimizes app for PWA

A couple of things to keep note of are 
    - service worker

We want to create seperate directories for everything
Follow best practice!!!! (comps, hooks, utilites)
                         (create directory for static resources like images in public folder!)

To install a PWA on a device, they must be SERVED
via HTTPS (secured with an SSL certificate). 
We can do this MANY WAYS (vercel, netlify) but we'll use
    - deploy to FIREBASE
        (install firebase cl tools via "npm i -g firebase-tools")
    - "firebase init hosting"
    - either use a new or existing project
    - use build as public directory
